 HR Analytics and Employee Churn Analysis
This project applies data science principles to HR analytics, specifically addressing employee churn or "turnover," which refers to employees leaving the organization, either voluntarily or involuntarily. Employee churn has traditionally focused on the aggregate rates of employees leaving. However, modern HR analytics expands this by identifying individuals at high risk of leaving, allowing organizations to proactively retain valuable employees.
Goals of HR Analytics
The two primary objectives of HR analytics are:
1. Providing Insights: Helping the organization better understand its workforce and managing employees to reach business goals efficiently.
2. Identifying Key Data for Predictive Models: Determining which data points are essential to capture for models that help predict how to maximize returns on human capital investment.
 Understanding Employee Churn
"Churn" in HR describes the rate and instances of employee departure. The process involves analyzing historical churn rates to predict future turnover, a valuable metric to optimize retention strategies and reduce the costs associated with employee replacement. Data warehousing tools can analyze churn data over time, but HR analytics can also predict specific individuals at high churn risk.
The Data Science Process in HR Analytics
To address employee churn effectively, this project follows the data science lifecycle:
1. Define the Goal
   Identify the HR business problem, which in this case is minimizing employee churn by understanding and predicting employee terminations. 
2. Collect and Manage Data  
   Gather relevant data, often from HR Information Systems (HRIS) or data warehouses. For this project, we use a simple CSV file containing a decade of employee records.
3. Build the Model
   Select appropriate data mining approaches, such as classification, regression, or clustering, to predict employees likely to leave. The goal is to separate high-risk employees from those likely to stay.


4. Evaluate and Refine the Model  
   Test different algorithms to find the most accurate model, refining data inputs and model parameters as needed to improve predictive accuracy.
5. Present Results and Document  
   Once the model achieves reliable predictions, document and present findings. The model should provide actionable insights to improve HR decision-making.
6. Deploy the Model  
   Use the model on new data to predict potential churn before it occurs, allowing proactive HR management.

Defining the Business Questions
For employee retention, the organization seeks to answer:
What proportion of our staff is leaving?
 Where is turnover occurring?
 How do age and length of service affect terminations?
 What other factors contribute to churn?
 Can we predict future terminations, and if so, how accurately?

 Data Overview
After consultation, the following attributes were identified for analysis:
EmployeeID: Unique identifier
Record Date, Birth Date, Original Hire Date, Termination Date: Key dates for analysis
Age and Length of Service: Employee demographics
City, Department, Job Title, Store Name, Gender: Basic employee information
Termination Reason and Type: Insights into voluntary or involuntary turnover
Status Year, Status: Snapshot of employee status (ACTIVE or TERMINATED) per year
Business Unit: Location of employment (e.g., Stores or Head Office)


Data Splits
The organization provides ten years of data (2006-2015). Data from 2006-2014 is used for training, while 2015 data serve as the test set, including both active employees and terminations per year.

 Modeling Employee Churn
This project aims to build predictive models using historical data to:
1. Identify which employees may be at high risk of leaving.
2. Understand key factors influencing employee churn.
3. Enable HR to implement proactive retention strategies.

By combining HR expertise with predictive analytics, this project empowers the organization to make data-driven decisions to retain valuable employees and reduce the costs of turnover.
